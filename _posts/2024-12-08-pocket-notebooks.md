# Pocket Notebooks
Picture this - the perfect pocket notebook. You are out doing your daily tasks: maybe you are walking your dog and you had an idea you don't want to lose, or someone gives you their contact information you need to remember, or you are in the middle of a meeting and there is a critical piece of information you can't afford to forget. What do you do?

Well, most of us would probably reach for our phone. This isn't the wrong option - there are a lot of benefits to taking a note on our phone, especially if there is a specific, structured way the information should be captured. But what about everything else?

- What about in a meeting where pulling out a phone and starting to type on it and it would be considered rude?
- What about when you left your larger notebook back at your desk / in your bag because it is too big to carry around in your hands all the time?
- What about when you need that free-form format of pen and paper, and a digital device just won't cut it?
