# Making things up

I definitely like to make things up when i can:

- This by any other name would be just as sweet.
- Other item

Are there many ways to do this? Yes there are.

Thought here is to write a post that talks about what being a nerd, meaning really getting into something, makes you a better person.

Being a nerd will make you a better person. Why?

1.	Because it makes you focus on something other than yourself
2.	There will inevitably be a community around it, which means you have to figure out how to work with people

And other reasons.
