There is little software that I still use 5 years later. Usually, something new comes along within a couple of years, and I don't stick with the software by choice. 10 years later? Almost unheard of. 20 years later?.... impossible! Nothing works 20 years later unless... you are an html quine.

## Why TiddlyWiki?

For those that are not familiar, [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is a "non-linear notebook", which means it is essentially sticky notes on steroids. It was the digital [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de) before they became cool, all using the earliest of client-side web tech.
