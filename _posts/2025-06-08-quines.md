There is little software that I still use 5 years later. Usually, something new comes along within a couple of years, and I don't stick with the software by choice. 10 years later? Almost unheard of. 20 years later?.... impossible! Nothing works 20 years later unless... you are an html quine.

## Why TiddlyWiki?

For those that are not familiar, [TiddlyWiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/) is a "non-linear notebook", which means it is essentially sticky notes on steroids. It was the digital [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de) before they became cool. Most interestingly, though, is that *<gasp>* files created in 2007 still work today!

## TiddlyWiki's Approach to Tech

So much of the tech in our lives revolves around one thing: lock-in. That is to say: to keep you stuck with their product, giving it as much eyeball time as they can get. This is notably different than what it should be: to provide the most useful tools to make things in life easier, more efficient, more effective. Some might argue that these two are one and the same: if people are spending a lot of time on a particular piece of software, it must be because it meets this definition of being a tool. But there-in lies the rub: tech companies are VERY good at human psychology, including your best and worst instincts. More time on a product != more value, no matter what they would have you think.

TiddlyWiki, and many other open source tools, take a different approach. This approach is, arguably, much more in line with the ideal that tech === valuable tool. Mostly, what makes them different is the lack of a capitalistic incentive. Not that there is inherently anything wrong with
