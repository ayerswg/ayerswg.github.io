% On Minimalism

Recently, I have been attempting to create a minimalistic life. I have gotten rid of my smartphone - I now have a "feature phone", meaning it only does a couple of select things:

- Send/receive calls
- Send/receive texts
- Serve as a hotspot for another device

Through these combination of features, I have been able to move away from having a distraction-leading smartphone.
