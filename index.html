      beardquest was originally used by my friend 
      and I to track our hike along the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) from Mexico to Canada.
      Since that hike was completed in 2007, I have found myself wanting to re-purpose this site to
      impart what little wisdom I have gained over the years to interested readers,
      building what I hope will be a biased yet pragmatic encyclopedia of tips and tricks for living a good, simple life.
