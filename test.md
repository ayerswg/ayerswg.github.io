Here is a title
===============

What _happens_ if I write all of this in plain text? The biggest problem will be lists:

+ Here is a list item
+ Here is another
++ Here is a sub item

And then a **url** can be done like [this](https://www.google.com).

What about tables?

|Column A|Column B|Column C|
|:-------|:-------|:-------|
|Dog     |Cat     |Ferret  |

And then there are block quotes:

> Here is an important quote

What about task lists?

+ [ ] Here is an item
+ [x] Here is a completed item

There are also items that can be ~struck~ out.

0. How about this as an ordered list?
0. Then does everything become ordered?
