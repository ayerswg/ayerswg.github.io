% May 24, 2020

Switchel has been one of my favorite drinks for a while now. Whenever we get a good batch of local honey, my first instinct is to mix it into some cold water with lemon juice and apple cider vinegar. I would highly recommend this as a replacement for lemonade.

Ingredients
------------

- 3 cups of water
- 1 tablespoon of honey
- 1 lemon squeezed
- 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
