# About

This repository contains the contents of the beardquest website. To build the site, you will need both the [pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) command line tools.

Once you have the tools installed, simply run `make clean` to remove the existing html files, and `make all` to rebuild from edits. Note that webpages are written with the `.pmd` extension to distinguish pandoc markdown from normal markdown.
